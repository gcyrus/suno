 # Create a song in the same genre and vibe as (Name of a song, artist, genre, theme, etc...)

---

End with styles of music only 3-8 words long in total (instruments, genre, etc.), separated by commas

    Write these lyrics as if a human wrote them

    The entire lyrics should be less than but close to 2000 characters

    Use a unique song lyrics format with different verse formats, line formats, chorus formats, etc.

    Be creative with the structure and flow between different sections

    Be strategic with the lyrical structure and syllable structure. Also be strategic with each line's length, number of syllables, structure, etc.

    Use lots and I mean lots of structure and direction within the lyric section, this can be instrument changes, mood changes, drops, etc. and doesn't have to be limited to the start of section, and can be placed whenever.

Use a unique and varying line structure like this mixing it up with longer lines, and shorter lines. Lines can be between 1-12 words long

Tips and Tricks when making the lyrics:

Structural Meta Tags

These define the song's section layout and flow.

[Intro] — Sets the tone for the song, often instrumental or light vocals.

[Verse] — Tells the story, introduces the theme or main ideas.

[Pre-Chorus] — Builds tension between the verse and chorus, leads to the emotional high.

[Chorus] — The main hook or emotional core; typically repeated for impact.

[Bridge] — A contrasting section that breaks up the repetition, often introspective or climactic.

[Hook] — A super catchy line, sometimes part of the chorus or a standalone earworm.

[Break] — An instrumental or rhythmic break, offering a breather or build-up.

[Interlude] — A more atmospheric or instrumental section between verses/choruses.

[Outro] — The closing section, wrapping up the song's theme or fading out.

[End] — A defined, clear ending — often abrupt or dramatic.

Usage: Structure tags organize the song into recognizable sections, ensuring a balanced progression.

2. Mood/Style Meta Tags

These set the emotional tone or delivery style.

[Sad Verse] — A melancholic, softer delivery for emotional impact.

[Happy Chorus] — A bright, uplifting feel, usually major key.

[Rapped Verse] — Spoken-word style, rhythm-heavy delivery.

[Melancholy] — A general tone of sadness or longing across any section.

[Quiet arrangement] — Minimal, stripped-down sound, often intimate.

Usage: Mood tags influence how the melody and instrumentation feel — light, dark, powerful, or soft.

3. Instrumental Meta Tags

Define specific instruments or sound elements.

[Guitar Solo] — A lead guitar break, often expressive or shreddy.

[Fingerstyle Guitar Solo] — Softer, more intricate plucked guitar melodies.

[Percussion Break] — A rhythmic drum/percussion-only section.

[Melodic Bass] — Bass that carries the melody rather than just rhythm.

[Brass stab] — Sharp, powerful brass hits, commonly used in funk or pop.

[Brass melody] — A melodic brass line, more sustained and melodic.

[Backing vocals] — Harmonies or layered secondary vocals.

Usage: These shape the instrumentation, ensuring specific sounds stand out.

4. Vocalization Meta Tags

Control vocal style and delivery.

[Female Narrator] — Ensures a female vocal lead.

[Male Voice] — Ensures a male vocal lead.

[Duet] — Encourages two vocalists interacting (note: may need multiple tries to get right).

(Ahh ahh ahh) — Vocal ad-libs or harmonized vocal sounds.

[Distorted vocals] — Gritty, overdriven vocal effect — great for rock or industrial.

[Autotune] — Modern, pitch-corrected vocal effect — common in pop/rap.

[Chant] — Group-style, rhythmic vocals — think stadium anthems or tribal vibes.

Usage: These define how the voice sounds or who sings — crucial for the song's feel.

5. Composition/Arrangement Meta Tags

Guide advanced musical progression and arrangement.

[Ascending progression] — A rising melody or chord pattern, building excitement.

[Dramatic twist] — An emotional or musical shift — key change, tempo switch, or mood swing.

[Harmonic surprise] — Unexpected chords or harmonies for intrigue.

[Climactic crescendo] — Gradual build-up to a powerful high point.

[Beat switch] — Sudden rhythm or tempo change — great for rap or EDM transitions.

[Breakdown] — A stripped-back, tension-building section — common in electronic or metal.

[Ambient interlude] — A softer, spacey break, often atmospheric.

[Counterpoint harmony] — Multiple melodies weaving together harmoniously.

Usage: These add complexity or surprise to prevent monotony.

6. Genre-Specific Tags

Lean into specific sounds and styles.

[303 Acid Bassline] — Squelchy, resonant bass (classic acid house vibe).

[808 beats] — Deep, booming bass drum and snare hits — a hip-hop/trap essential.

[909 beats] — Punchy drum machine sounds, iconic in house/techno.

[Chillwave synth] — Dreamy, lo-fi, reverb-heavy synth tones.

[Chiptune effects] — Retro, 8-bit video game sound effects.

[Disco funk] — Slap bass, funky grooves, and retro vibes.

[Dubstep wobbles] — Heavily modulated, growling bass sounds.

[Tech house grooves] — Rhythmic, percussive beats with minimal melodies.

[Tropical house vibes] — Steel drums, breezy melodies, beachy feel.

Usage: Genre tags help define the song's overall vibe or recreate a specific sound style.

7. Classical/World/Fusion Tags

Incorporate traditional or unique sounds.

[Celtic melody] — Lively, folky melodies with a traditional feel.

[Chamber music section] — Strings or small ensemble arrangements for a classical touch.

[Guzheng & Piano & Chinese Drum & Cello] — Fusion of Chinese instruments with Western melodies.

Usage: Great for cinematic, fusion, or culturally rich compositions.

Example:

[Intro, Ambient interlude, Melancholy]

Whispers in the dark, I can't find my way

Echoes of a past life, they beg me to stay

[Verse, Sad Verse, Fingerstyle Guitar Solo]

Fading footsteps on an endless road

A heart that's heavy, but it won't let go

Shadows dancing where the light used to be

I'm chasing a ghost that looks just like me

[Pre-Chorus, Harmonic surprise, Rising tension]

Every breath, a silent scream

I'm waking up inside a dream

[Chorus, Powerpop Chorus, Backing vocals]

I'm lost in the echoes, calling my name

Caught in the static, but I'm not the same

Breaking the silence, burning the night

I'll find myself in the afterlight

[Bridge, Dramatic twist, Guitar Solo]

The sky is falling, but I'm reaching high

The ashes remind me that I'm still alive

[Chorus, Climactic crescendo, Backing vocals]

I'm lost in the echoes, calling my name

Caught in the static, but I'm not the same

Breaking the silence, burning the night

I'll find myself in the afterlight

[Outro, Quiet arrangement, Ambient interlude]

Whispers in the dark, but I'm not afraid

The echoes have faded… but I've found my way

Additional tips:

[Whisper]/[soft whisper] can at times work

^ seems to get the AI to go to a higher vocal note. I've tested it a few times with good results in older songs.

If you do use ^ you can use _ to bring it back down as well from what my tests have shown so far.

Though this is all subjectively based on my own experimentation. You may want to try it yourself and see if you get the same results.

Although I had found that [end] frequently does not work. Even [5 second fade out][end] doesn't seem to work. However, those commands will prevent further vocals being added to the track, so there is that.

This is an example of using meta tags in custom mode to produce a custom instrumental:

[Intro, Deep orchestral hits, Heavy electronic bass] [Verse, Tense strings, Pounding drums, Dark synths] [Bridge, Rising brass, Ominous choir] [Chorus, Full orchestra, Heroic brass, Powerful timpani] [Interlude, Atmospheric pads, Haunting piano melody] [Verse, Return of tense strings, Aggressive electronic elements] [Final Chorus, Majestic orchestral climax, Epic percussion, Synth arpeggios] [Outro, Fading strings, Distant echoes, Dark synth resonance]

For a fading chorus outro, try this format:

[Outro, Chorus fading out, Echoing harmonies]

We fade into the light, Leaving shadows behind, Together we rise, Into the endless sky.

[Fading synths, Stripped-down echo]

For layered backing vocals:

[Chorus, Backing vocals]

I'm lost in the echoes, calling my name

(Backing vocals: "Calling my name")

Caught in the static, but I'm not the same

(Backing vocals: "I'm not the same")

This style works best for short, repeated lines or echoes.
